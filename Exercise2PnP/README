In this exercise, the camera pose is calculated when the 2D to 3D point correspondences and the camera calibration matrix K are given. In general, we need atleast 6 point correspondences to solve this problem but in this case we have 12 points, which makes the system over-determined. More information about this can be found in the course slides and the assignment.
